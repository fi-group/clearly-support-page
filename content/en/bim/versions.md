## Version ? (Latest)

### Release Notes:

- Admins can now create, update, and delete custom BQL (BIM.works Query Language) queries to filter BIM models more precisely and share them across projects.
    - These queries replace the previous "filters" (e.g. show only IfcWalls).

- Export a specific selection of models as 3D Tilesfrom a project instead of the entire project.

- Export filtered models to 3D tiles (e.g., export only the third floors from multiple buildings).

- Query and filter multiple models at once to get a combined view of your data.

- Users can now upload their own IDS file to validate model information.
