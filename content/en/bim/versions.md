## Version 1.37.0 (Latest)

### Release Notes:

- **Integration:**
    * **Advanced 3D Tiles Export:** You now have much more control over what you export. The 3D Tiles export functionality has been enhanced to allow you to export a selection of models from your project, or even a specific filtered view (e.g., only the third floor of a building).

- **UI:**
    * **Query Multiple Models:** The filtering and querying tools are no longer disabled when you're previewing multiple models. You can now apply filters and run queries across several models at once, improving your workflow and analysis.
    * **Custom IDS Checks:** You can now *upload and use your own IDS files* to run checks on a model, allowing you to quickly verify compliance without external intervention. These temporary checks and their results are visible during your session.
    * **BQL Queries (for SuperAdmins):** For our advanced users, we have implemented the ability to create, update, and delete BQL (BIM Query Language) queries. These customizable queries replace the old filters and can be made available to one, multiple, or all projects, providing a powerful new way to manage and analyze your data.

- **Technical Updates & Fixes:**
    * **Note from our developers:** Some exports of older models may fail. We are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it in an upcoming release. Newly uploaded models are not affected.

## Version 1.36.0

### Release Notes:

- **Integration:**

    * **Unified Login:** You now log in to Clearly.BIM using your *Clearly.Hub account*. This creates a single, streamlined entry point for both platforms.

If you are a member of multiple hubs with a subscription, you can select which one to use upon login. Several new subscription models have been implemented to offer more flexible pricing and features.
    * **Direct Publishing to Clearly.Hub:** You can now *register a BIM model directly as a 3D Tiles stream* in Clearly.Hub, making it easier to share your models with the wider platform.

- **UI:**
    * **More Consistent Experience:** The login process and user settings have been streamlined to align with Clearly.Hub, creating a more cohesive experience across our products.
    * **Enhanced Georeferencing:** New georeferencing options have been added, giving you more control over how your models are positioned. You can now adjust and correct georeference settings directly within the viewer.
