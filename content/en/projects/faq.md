### 2. Can I export project data?

This will show you all the available projects and their processes you can make an export of.

### 3. I get a warning when I try to edit an item like "By editing this value, the process will go back to ...". What does this mean?

Editing a value in a task can sometimes require you to go back and re-do subsequent steps. 

This happens because the new value may affect the outcome of later tasks in the workflow, so the system needs you to review and complete those steps again to ensure accuracy.

### 4. Map items move unexpectedly when zooming, or the map appears white/blank.

If you notice that items plotted on the map shift their position when you zoom in or out, or if the map background becomes white or doesn't load correctly, there's likely an issue with the connection to the underlying map service.

Resolving this requires checking the map service configuration. Please **contact our support team** for assistance, and they will help diagnose and fix the connection problem.

### 5. I want to join a project on Clearly, how do I do that?

The standard procedure for creating an account/joining a project is to be invited by the project administrators of the main contractor, as they manage user access for their projects directly.

Once they have added you, you will automatically receive an email with an invitation link to create your Clearly account and set a password.

### 6. I don't see the plus sign on the left bottom of the screen that allows to create items. Why? 

The problem is likely that you have not yet been assigned to the process you are trying to create items with the role "Taakhouder" (Assignee). 

The easiest way to do change member's roles is on the bulk edit page functionality in project settings:
https://clearly.app/org/{ORGANIZATION_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}/settings/bulk-edit

Bare in mind that only admins of the project can go to the project settings page. On that page, they can select a user and choose the process they want to assign them to (e.g., Stakeholders Process), and give them the appropriate role.

To help admins choose, here is a quick explanation of the two main roles in Clearly:
- **Taakhouder (Assignee)**: This role can create, edit, and delete items. For a user to be able to create new items (and see the "+" (create items) button), they must be a "Taakhouder" in the first task of that process (e.g., "1. Stakeholder aanmaken").

- **Belanghebbende (Stakeholder)**: This role has "view-only" rights. They can see items but cannot create, edit, or delete them. That's why they won't see the "+" (create items) button.

Clearly also allows these roles to be reflected at the task level for more granular control. For example, you can make sure that someone can only create stakeholder items (as a "Taakhouder" in the first task of a process), and then be a viewer (as a "Belanghebbende") for the upcoming tasks in the same process.

### 7. I have a new phone and would like to set up MFA. How do I get a new QR?

To set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your Clearly account on your new phone, you have to disable and re-enable the MFA from your account. Please follow these steps:

- Log in to your Clearly account at www.clearly.app using your username and password.
- Navigate to "mijn account" (top right) to find the "Multi Factor Authenticatie" section.
- Click "DEACTIVEREN" to turn off your current MFA setting.
- Then, click "STEL MFA IN" to begin the setup for your new device. A new QR code will appear on your screen.
- Open your Authenticator app on your new phone and scan this QR code.
- Enter the 6-digit verification code from the authenticator app into Clearly to complete the process.

### 8. The link sent by Clearly to create an account expired. What should I do?

If the link sent by Clearly to create an account has expired, please **contact our support team** for further assistance.

### 9. I don't see a process in the project that I know should be there. Why? 

The problem is likely that you have **not** yet been assigned to the the specific process in the project that you are trying to create items at. You can get this solved by asking one of the project admins to assign you a role in the process. 

The admins can use the the following URL (with the correct organization and project names) to see which members are assigned to which processes. The UI also shows the relevant process tasks with people that are assigned to those tasks in a standard way:
https://clearly.app/org/{ORGANIZATION_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}/settings/processes

---

### 10. I keep getting an email from Clearly as "*_You were mentioned in 0 comments and 0 tasks have been assigned to you._*" Why and how to stop getting these emails?

The emails are being generated based on your personal notification preferences in your Clearly profile. Currently, your settings are configured to:
- Send you a weekly email summary about mentions and new tasks.
- Send this email even if there are no new updates for you (i.e., 0 mentions and 0 tasks).

You can easily change these notification preferences on your account:
- Log in to your Clearly account.
- Go to your profile settings, found under "My Account" .
- Look for the "Notifications" section. You will want to adjust the following:
    - The option *_"Send an email when I'm mentioned or get an task assigned"_*. You can change to "Never", for example.
    - The toggle for *_"I also want to receive a daily or weekly e-mail when there are no updates
for me."_*. You can switch this off.
    - Adjusting these settings will stop these particular emails.
